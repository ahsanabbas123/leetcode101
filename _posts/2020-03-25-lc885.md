# Question
On a 2 dimensional grid with R rows and C columns, we start at (r0, c0) facing east.
Here, the north-west corner of the grid is at the first row and column, and the south-east corner of the grid is at the last row and column.
Now, we walk in a clockwise spiral shape to visit every position in this grid.
Whenever we would move outside the boundary of the grid, we continue our walk outside the grid (but may return to the grid boundary later.)

Return a list of coordinates representing the positions of the grid in the order they were visited.
```
Example

Input: R = 1, C = 4, r0 = 0, c0 = 0
Output: [[0,0],[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]]
```

# Solution
The idea is to move through the whole path and whenever we come inside the grid, we add the element to the answer. Now, how do we move along the path? If you observe carefully, there is patter in the steps:
```
move right 1 step, turn right
move down 1 step, turn right
move left 2 steps, turn right
move top 2 steps, turn right
move right 3 steps, turn right
move down 3 steps, turn right
move left 4 steps, turn right
move top 4 steps, turn right

Notice the pattern: 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5...

Let n be index of this sequence.
Then A0 = 1, A1 = 1, A2 = 2 and so on
We can find that An = n/2 + 1
```

Now we just have to figure out how to turn right. There is a general method to rotate when traversing a matrix. We define two arrays:
```
vector<int> dx = {0, 1, 0, -1}; // right, down, left, up
vector<int> dy = {1, 0, -1, 0}; // right, down, left, up
```
Suppose we are on coordinate `{x, y}`. `{x+dx[0], y+dy[0]}` is then the coordinate after taking a step towards right. `{x+dx[1], y+dy[1]}` is then the coordinate after taking a step towards down. And so on...

Code:
```
vector<vector<int>> spiralMatrixIII(int R, int C, int r0, int c0) {
    vector<int> dx = {0, 1, 0, -1};
    vector<int> dy = {1, 0, -1, 0};

    vector<vector<int>> res;
    int x = r0, y=c0, n=0, k=0;

    while (res.size() != R*C) {
        // n/2+1 steps in the same direction
        for (int i=0; i<n/2+1; i++) {
            if (x>=0 && x<R && y>=0 && y<C) {
                res.push_back({x, y});
            }
            x += dx[k%4];
            y += dy[k%4];
        }
        // rotate next time
        k++;
        n++;
    }

    return res;
}
```
