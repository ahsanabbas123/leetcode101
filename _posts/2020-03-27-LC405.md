If we were to convert a decimal number to hex on paper and pen, the most common approach is to first convert the decimal number to binary and then make groups of 4 bits in the binary and replace them with hex equivalent.
```
    26    ->   0001 1010    ->     1a
  base-10       base-2           base-16
```
Luckily, computers store numbers in 2's complement binary form and we can perform logical operations (AND, NOT, OR, XOR) on them. So all we have to do is keep extracting groups of 4 from the binary and convert them into hex. If we have a number n then n&15 gives us the least significant (rightmost) 4 digits of the number. This is because binary equivalent of 15 is 1111. We can hence follow a simple algorithm:
```
while (n>0):
    convert n&15 to hex
    right shift number by 4 bits
```
We have to do a unsigned right shift by 4 bits so that the condition (n>0) holds. In Java this is simple using the `>>>` operator but in C++ you'll have to typecase the `int` to `unsigned int`.

```
string toHex(int num) {
    // sanity check
    if (num==0)
        return "0";

    string hexMap = "0123456789abcdef";
    unsigned int n = (unsigned int) num;
    string res = "";

    while (n>0) {
        res += hexMap[(n&15)];
        n>>=4;
    }
    reverse(res.begin(), res.end()); // note that we stores the least significant bits first

    return res;
}
```
