The question doesn't really require any Data Structure or Algorithmic knowledge. It only requires you to sit down and observe a 3x3 tic-tac-toe board to find out the minimum number of conditions you would have to check to know that it's a valid state. Let's look at some conditions:
1. Clearly, number of X >= number of O because X takes the first turn
2. At the same time, number of X - number of O cannot exceed 1 as they play turn by turn
3. X or O cannot win the game twice, that is:
	- 2 rows cannot be "XXX" or "OOO". Note that this is not a valid state as per condition 2 so we don't have to consider this.
	- 2 columns cannot be "XXX" or "OOO". Note that this is not a valid state as per condition 2 so we don't have to consider this.\
	- Both diagonals cannot contain only "X" or only "O". Actually, this condition is wrong! Both diagonals **can** be filled with only X or only O. Consider this valid state:
	```
	X O X		 X O X
	O   O -> O X O
	X O X    X O X
	```
4. Both "X" and "O" cannot win the game, that is:
	- If one row is "XXX", any other cannot be "OOO"
	- If one column is "XXX", the other cannot be "OOO"
5. If X has won the game then number of X should be equal to number of O - 1 (as O doesn't get to play the next chance)
6. If O has won the game then number of X should be equal to number of O (as X doesn't get to play the next chance)

Note that the condition 3 above is contained in all others so we do not need to check that.

```
bool validTicTacToe(vector<string>& board) {
		bool xWon = false, oWon = false;
		int numX = 0, numO = 0;
		// check rows
		for (string s : board) {
				if (s=="XXX")
						xWon=true;
				if (s=="OOO")
						oWon = true;
				for (char c : s) {
						if (c=='X')
								numX++;
						else if (c=='O')
								numO++;
				}
		}
		// conditions 1, 2 and 4
		if (numO>numX || numX-numO>1 || (xWon && oWon))
				return false;

		// check columns
		for (int j=0; j<3; j++) {
				string temp = "";
				for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {
						temp+=board[i][j];
				}
				if (temp == "XXX")
						xWon = true;
				if (temp == "OOO")
						oWon = true;
		}

		// check diagonals
		if (board[0][0] == 'X' && board[1][1] == 'X' && board[2][2] == 'X')
				xWon = true;
		if (board[0][0] == 'O' && board[1][1] == 'O' && board[2][2] == 'O')
				oWon = true;

		if (board[0][2] == 'X' && board[1][1] == 'X' && board[2][0] == 'X')
				xWon = true;
		if (board[0][2] == 'O' && board[1][1] == 'O' && board[2][0] == 'O')
				oWon = true;

		// condition 4
		if (xWon && oWon)
				return false;

		// condition 5
		if (xWon && numX-numO==0)
				return false;

		// condition 6
		if (oWon && numX-numO==1)
				return false;

		return true;
}
```
Time complexity: O(1) as the board is of constant size (3x3)
