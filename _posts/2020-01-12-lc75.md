Problem: Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue. Red is denoted by the integer 0, white by 1 and blue by 2.
Example:
```
Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

This is a standard problem in Computer Science and is known as [_Dutch National Flag Problem_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_national_flag_problem) or _Three way partition problem_.

The idea is to maintain four sections with the following invariant:
1. Section 1: nums[0...low-1] having only red color (denoted by 0)
2. Section 2: nums[low...mid-1] having only white color (denoted by 1)
3. Section 3: nums[mid...high] having unknown elements
4. Section 4: nums[high+1...size(nums)-1] having only blue color (denoted by 2)

We keep three integer low, mid and high where low denotes the next available index for a 0 and high denotes the next available index for a 2. Go through the solution for a clearer idea.

Solution:
```
void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
        int low = 0, mid = 0, high = nums.size()-1;

        while (mid <= high) {
            if (nums[mid] == 1)
                mid++;
            else if (nums[mid] == 0)
                swap(nums[low++], nums[mid++]);
            else
                swap(nums[mid], nums[high--]);
        }
    }
```

Time complexity: O(n)<br>
Space complexity: O(1)
