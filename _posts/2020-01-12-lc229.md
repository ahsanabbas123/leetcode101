Problem: Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.
Similar problem: [LC 169. Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)

Solving this question using a map that stores the frequency of each element is pretty straightforward. This problem is an extension of [LC 169. Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/) and I highly recommend you to [view the solution](https://sarthak-sehgal.github.io/leetcode101/lc169/) of that and try to solve this problem on your own. It is an extension of the famous [Boyre Moore's Majority Voting Element](https://gregable.com/2013/10/majority-vote-algorithm-find-majority.html) algorithm. The solution below is pretty straightforward to understand once you know the actual algorithm (applied in LC 169).

Instead of going through the array twice, here we have to go through the array three times. The first time we keep track of the potential majority elements using the variables `num1, count1, num2, count2`. The second time we check whether `num1` is actually a majority element and the third time we check the same for `num2`. Note that there cannot be more than two majority elements as each has to appear strictly more than floor(n/3) times.


```
vector<int> majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int size = nums.size(), num1=-1, count1=0, num2=-1, count2=0;
        vector<int> ans;

        for (int i=0; i<size; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == num1) {
                count1++;
                continue;
            }

            if (nums[i] == num2) {
                count2++;
                continue;
            }

            if (count1 == 0) {
                num1 = nums[i];
                count1++;
                continue;
            }

            if (count2 == 0) {
                num2 = nums[i];
                count2++;
                continue;
            }

            count1--;
            count2--;
        }

        count1=count2=0;
        for (int i=0; i<size; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == num1)
                count1++;
            if (nums[i] == num2)
                count2++;
        }

        if (count1>size/3)
            ans.push_back(num1);
        if (count2>size/3)
            ans.push_back(num2);

        return ans;
    }
