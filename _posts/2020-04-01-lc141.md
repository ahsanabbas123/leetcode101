This is a classical problem solved most optimally using the Bellman-Ford Cycle Detection algorithm a.k.a. Tortoise Hair approach. The algorithm is as follows:
- Traverse the Linked List using two pointers "slow" and "fast"
- Move the slow pointer by 1 and the fast pointer by 2
- If these pointers meet at some node then there is a cycle else there is no cycle.

The proof is pretty interesting and [can be found on StackExchance](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/913499/proof-of-floyd-cycle-chasing-tortoise-and-hare).

```
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        ListNode *slow = head;
        ListNode *fast = head;
        while(fast!=NULL && fast->next!=NULL){
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
            if(slow==fast)
                return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```
