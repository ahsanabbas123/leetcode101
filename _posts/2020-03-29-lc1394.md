# Solution
The question is pretty straightforward. Iterate through an array and keep track of the frequencies using a hashmap. Then iterate through the hashmap, check which number's frequency is equal to the number itself and return the maximum such number.

```
int findLucky(vector<int>& arr) {
    unordered_map<int, int> freq;
    for (int i : arr)
        freq[i]++;
    int res = -1;
    for (auto p : freq) {
        if (p.first == p.second)
            res = max(res, p.first);
    }
    
    return res;
}
```
