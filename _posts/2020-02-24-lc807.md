# Question
In a 2 dimensional array grid, each value grid[i][j] represents the height of a building located there. We are allowed to increase the height of any number of buildings, by any amount (the amounts can be different for different buildings). Height 0 is considered to be a building as well. 

At the end, the "skyline" when viewed from all four directions of the grid, i.e. top, bottom, left, and right, must be the same as the skyline of the original grid. A city's skyline is the outer contour of the rectangles formed by all the buildings when viewed from a distance. See the following example.

What is the maximum total sum that the height of the buildings can be increased?
```
Example:
Input: grid = [[3,0,8,4],[2,4,5,7],[9,2,6,3],[0,3,1,0]]
Output: 35
Explanation:
The grid is:
[ [3, 0, 8, 4],
  [2, 4, 5, 7],
  [9, 2, 6, 3],
  [0, 3, 1, 0] ]

The skyline viewed from top or bottom is: [9, 4, 8, 7]
The skyline viewed from left or right is: [8, 7, 9, 3]

The grid after increasing the height of buildings without affecting skylines is:

gridNew = [ [8, 4, 8, 7],
            [7, 4, 7, 7],
            [9, 4, 8, 7],
            [3, 3, 3, 3] ]
```

# Solution
The skyline from top/bottom is the maximum of each column and the skyline from left/right is the maximum of each row. So an element grid[i][j] can be increased until it reaches the maximum of row i or column j. So `grid[i][j] = min(max(row i), max(column j));`.

```
int maxIncreaseKeepingSkyline(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int s = grid.size();
    int maxLens[2][s];

    // maxLens[0][i] stores maximum for each row i
    // maxLens[1][j] stores maximum for each column j

    // initialise maxLens
    for (int i=0; i<2; i++)
        for (int j=0; j<s; j++)
            maxLens[i][j] = 0;

    // store maximum for each row/column
    for (int i=0; i<s; i++)
        for (int j=0; j<s; j++) {
            maxLens[0][i] = max(maxLens[0][i], grid[i][j]);
            maxLens[1][j] = max(maxLens[1][j], grid[i][j]);
        }

    int ans = 0;
    for (int i=0; i<s; i++)
        for (int j=0; j<s; j++) {
            ans += min(maxLens[0][i], maxLens[1][j])-grid[i][j];
        }

    return ans;
}
```
