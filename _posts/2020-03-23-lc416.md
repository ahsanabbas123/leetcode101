# Solution
Let's say the sum of all elements in the array is `totSum`. The array can be partitioned into two equal halves only if totSum is even. Further, there should be a subset having sum = totSum/2. The first part, calculating totSum and imposing the even condition, is easy. How to check whether a subset having sum equal to totSum/2 exists? This can be solved using backtracking where we consider two cases: element i is in subset and element i is not in the subset and then recurse. This will take up lot of time though. Note that we essentially have to find a whether some elements from the input array make up the sum = totSum/2 - this problem is like the 0/1 knapsack problem which is classically solved using a 2D DP (it can also be solved using 1D DP but here I will only mention 2D DP solution). Define a 2D vector dp where dp[i][j] denotes whether sum=j can be formed using input[1..i]. Let's take an example, let input = [1, 5, 11, 5]. Here, totSum = 22 so we have to find a subset having sum=11. Let us define out 2D array as below:
```
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0 
1:  1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0 
5:  1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0  0 
11: 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0  1 
5:  1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1  1 

Here the columns represent sum from 0 to 11 and the rows represent the input elements used. The first row indicates that no input element is used. dp[i][j] = 1 if the specific sum j can be gotten from the first i numbers. If we can pick such a series of numbers from 0-i whose sum is j, dp[i][j] is true (=1), otherwise it is false (=0).
```

Transition function: For each number, if we don't pick it, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j], which means if the first i-1 elements has made it to j, dp[i][j] would also make it to j (we can just ignore nums[i-1]). If we pick nums[i-1], dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-nums[i-1]], which represents that j is composed of the current value nums[i] and the remaining composed of other previous numbers. Thus, the transition function is dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] || dp[i-1][j-nums[i-1]].

```
bool canPartition(vector<int>& nums) {
    int totSum=0;
    for (int i : nums)
        totSum+=i;
    
    if (totSum&1 || totSum<2)
        return false;
    
    int subsetSum = totSum/2;
    vector<vector<bool>> v(nums.size()+1, vector<bool>(subsetSum+1, false));
    
    for (int i=0; i<=nums.size(); i++)
        v[i][0] = true;
    for (int i=1; i<=nums.size(); i++) {
        for (int j=1; j<=subsetSum; j++) {
            v[i][j] = v[i-1][j];
            if (j-nums[i-1]>=0)
                v[i][j]=v[i][j]||v[i-1][j-nums[i-1]];
            if (j==subsetSum && v[i][j])
                return true;
        }
    }
    
    return false;
}
```
Time complexity: O(n*m) where n is the size of nums and m is the total sum of the numbers
Space complexity: O(n*m)
