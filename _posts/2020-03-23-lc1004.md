# Solution
The problem is similar to longest subarray sum so the first approach which comes into mind is a two pointer approach which is indeed correct. We will two points, i and j. We will keep incrementing i as we traverse through the array. If we come across a 0, we will decrement K. If K==-1, that means we have flipped one extra zero. We will then start incrementing j until we encounted another 0 (so that we do not flip this and K becomes 0). Think of j as an anchor.

Code implementation:
```
int longestOnes(vector<int>& A, int K) {
    int res=0, i, j;
    for (i=0, j=0; i<A.size(); i++) {
        if (A[i] == 0) {
            K--;
        }
        if (K==-1) {
            res = max(res, i-j);
            while (j<i && A[j]==1) j++;
            j++;
            K++;
        }
    }
    res = max(res, i-j);
    
    return res;
