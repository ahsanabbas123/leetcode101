This question can be reduced to [LC 198. House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/). Try solving it before proceeding if you haven't.

Key observations:
- The order of `nums` does not matter
- If we decide to pick `nums[i]` then we can pick all occurrences of `nums[i]` without any more harm
- `nums[i]` is in the range [1, 10000]

Since the order of nums does not matter and if we decide to pick nums[i], we can pick all its occurrences, let us store the frequency of each number in `nums`. We can either use a map (hash table) to store them of simply an array of length 100001 as nums[i] is in the range 1 to 10000. Let's store them in an array as we would need to iterate through the numbers in ascending order as you'll see below.

Define dp[i] as maximum points achieved by considering numbers from 1..i. For a number i, we have two choices:
1. Pick that number: we cannot pick the number i-1 now but we get points equal to `i*freq[i]`. So total points: `dp[i-2] + i*freq[i]`
2. Do not pick that number: total points in this case remain same as `dp[i-1]`

```
int deleteAndEarn(vector<int>& nums) {
		vector<int> freq(100001, 0);
		vector<int> dp(100001, 0);

		for (auto i : nums) freq[i]++;
		dp[1] = freq[1];

		for (int i=2; i<100001; i++)
				dp[i] = max(dp[i-2]+i*freq[i], dp[i-1]);

		return dp[100000];
}
```
