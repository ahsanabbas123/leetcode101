title: LC 939. Minimum Area Rectangle

Note that the question only asks to find the minimum area of a rectangle having sides parallel to x-axis and y-axis. If we have the two diagonal coordinates, `(x1,y1)` and `(x2,y2)` and given that the sides are parallel to x-axis and y-axis, it is easy to identify that the other two coordinates of the rectangle will be `(x1,y2)` and `(x2,y1)`.

```
		(x1,y2)								(x2,y2)
			------------------------
			|											 |
			|											 |
			------------------------
		(x1,y1)								(x2,y1)
```

We will use this to solve the question in `O(n^2)` time. The approach is to preprocess all the coordinates and for each x coordinate, store the set of corresponding y coordinates in a hash table (x -> {y1, y2, y3..}). Then, for each pair of coordinates, if they form a horizontal line (i.e., parallel to x-axis) or a vertical line (i.e., parallel to y-axis), we ignore them as we are only concerned about the coordinates in a diagonal. Else, the pair of points `(x1,y1)` and `(x2,y2)` form a rectangle only if we have the points `(x1,y2)` and `(x2,y1)` in the given input. We can check this simply by using the hash table/map we created earlier (y1 should exist in map[x2] and y2 should exist in map[x1]).

```
int minAreaRect(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
		// sanity check
		if (points.size()<4)
				return 0;

		unordered_map<int, unordered_set<int>> map;
		for (auto v : points) map[v[0]].insert(v[1]);

		int res = INT_MAX;
		for (int i=0; i<points.size(); i++) {
				for (int j=0; j<i; j++) {
						if (points[i][0] == points[j][0] || points[i][1] == points[j][1])
								continue;
						if (map[points[i][0]].count(points[j][1]) && map[points[j][0]].count(points[i][1]))
								res = min(res, abs((points[i][0]-points[j][0])*(points[i][1]-points[j][1])));
				}
		}

		return res == INT_MAX ? 0 : res;
}
```
