## Approach 1: Recursion + Memoization (Top-Down)
Consider each position {i,j} of the matrix to be the top-left corner of a square. If matrix[i][j] = 0, it does not form a square. If matrix[i][j] = 1, it forms a square of length 1. From this position, try extending length of the square by going right, bottom and diagonally (bottom right). Suppose the index to its right {i, j+1} forms a square of length 2, the index of its bottom {i+1, j} forms a square of length 2 and the index to its diagonal forms a square of length 1. Something like this:
```
Consider position {0,0}
1 1 1
1 1 1
1 1 0
```
Clearly, size of largest square formed by {0,0} as top left corner is 1, i.e., min({right, bottom, diagonal}). Note that number of squares with {0,0} as top-left corner = length of biggest square with {0,0} as top-left corner. In this case, first square is {0,0} on length 1 and second square of length 2 is enclosed between {0,0} and {1,1}.

```
class Solution {
public:
    /*
    * recursion + memo solution
    * consider each position [i, j] as the top-left corner of square - we check to its right, bottom and diagonal (towards bottom right)
    * size of square at [i, j] = min(right, bottom, diagonal)
    * Also, a square of size 3 will have a square of size 2 and 1 also so just add the length of square to answer:
            1 1 1
            1 1 1
            1 1 1
        square starting at [0,0] is of length 3. The three squares with [0,0] as their top left corners are: [0,0] single element itself, 2x2 square enclosed by [0,0] and [1,1], 3x3 square enclosed by [0,0] and [2,2]

    int dp[301][301];
    int dfs(vector<vector<int>>& A, int i, int j) {
        if(i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= A.size() || j >= A[0].size() || A[i][j] != 1)
            return 0;
        if(dp[i][j] != -1)
            return dp[i][j];
        int ans = 1;
        int l = dfs(A, i, j + 1), r = dfs(A, i + 1, j), t = dfs(A, i + 1, j + 1);
        ans = 1 + min(l, min(r, t));
        return dp[i][j] = ans;
    }

    int countSquares(vector<vector<int>>& A) {
        int ans = 0;
        int n = A.size(), m = A[0].size();
        memset(dp, -1, sizeof dp);
        for(int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < A[i].size(); j++) {
                if(A[i][j]) {
                    int sz = dfs(A, i, j); 
                    ans += sz;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
Time complexity: O(n*n)

## Approach 2: Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up)
For a bottom-up approach using dynamic programming, we just need to reverse our above thinking. Consider each index {i,j} as the bottom right corner of a square. Define dp[i][j] as the size of biggest square with {i,j} as its bottom right corner. Clearly, if matrix[i][j] = 0, dp[i][j] = 0. If matrix[i][j] = 1, dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i-1][j] <up>, dp[i][j-1] <left>, dp[i-1][j-1] <top-left diagonal>).

```
int countSquares(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
		int rows = matrix.size();
		if (!rows)
				return 0;
		int cols = matrix[0].size();
		int count = 0;
		
		for (int i=0; i<rows; i++) {
				for (int j=0; j<cols; j++) {
						if (matrix[i][j] == 1) {
								count++;
								if (i>0 && j>0)
										matrix[i][j] = min(matrix[i-1][j], min(matrix[i-1][j-1], matrix[i][j-1])) + 1;
								if (matrix[i][j] > 1)
										count+=matrix[i][j]-1;
						}
				}
		}
		
		return count;
}
```
