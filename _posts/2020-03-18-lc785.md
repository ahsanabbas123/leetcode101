# Solution
This is a pretty standard question for determining whether a given graph is bipartite. A [bipartite graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph) can be colored using two colors, say red and green, where no two adjacent nodes have the same color. Consider a graph coloring below:
```
Graph:
0----1
|    |
|    |
3----2

Coloring:
0: red
1: green
2: red
3: green

This ensures that no two adjacent nodes have the same color.
```
Knowing this, check for bipartite graph is simple. We apply standard DFS and start with a root node, say 0. We color 0 as red (represented by integer 1) and then color all its adjacent nodes with green (represented by integer 0) and then perform a DFS on adjacent nodes. Below is a iterative solution for the same. Please note that the graph can be disconnected as well so you have to take care of it.
```
bool isBipartite(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
    // snaity check
    if (graph.size() == 0)
        return true;

    // this stores colors of nodes and also works as a visited array. If color[node] = -1 then it is not visited yet
    vector<int> color(graph.size(), -1);
    stack<int> s;

    // graph maybe disconnected so visit each node
    for (int i=0; i<graph.size(); i++) {
        // if node is visited, continue
        if (color[i] != -1)
            continue;

        // color node as red
        color[i] = 1;
        s.push(i);

        while (!s.empty()) {
            int t = s.top();
            s.pop();

            for (int x : graph[t]) {
                // if adjacent node has same color, graph is not bipartite
                if (color[x] != -1 && color[x]==color[t])
                    return false;

                // color adjacent nodes with different color if it is not visited
                if (color[x] == -1) {
                    color[x] = color[t] == 1 ? 0 : 1;
                    s.push(x);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```
Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes
