# Question
In an alien language, surprisingly they also use english lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.
Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet, return true if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographicaly in this alien language.
```
Example 1:
Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.
```

# Solution
The approach is to first create a map of `alphabet -> ordering` which we can use to compare any two alphabets in O(1) time. Then, we can compare two adjacent words at a time to see if they are in the correct order.
```
bool isAlienSorted(vector<string>& words, string order) {
    unordered_map<char, int> m;
    int i = 0;
    for (char c : order)
        m[c] = i++;
    
    for (int i=0; i<words.size()-1; i++) {
        string w1 = words[i];
        string w2 = words[i+1];
        if (compareWords(w1, w2, m) <= 0)
            continue;
        return false;
    }
    
    return true;
}

// helper function to check if two words are in the correct order
// this function is very similar to the "strcmp" function in C which is used to compare two strings
int compareWords (string w1, string w2, unordered_map<char, int> m) {
    for (int i=0, j=0; i<w1.length() || j<w2.length(); i++, j++) {
        if (i==w1.length())
            return -1;
        if (j==w2.length())
            return 1;
        if (w1[i]==w2[j])
            continue;
        if (m[w1[i]] > m[w2[j]])
            return 1;
        else
            return -1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
Time complexity: O(N) where N is the total number of characters
