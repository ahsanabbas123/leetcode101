# Question
The power of an integer x is defined as the number of steps needed to transform x into 1 using the following steps:

- if x is even then x = x / 2
- if x is odd then x = 3 * x + 1

For example, the power of x = 3 is 7 because 3 needs 7 steps to become 1 (3 --> 10 --> 5 --> 16 --> 8 --> 4 --> 2 --> 1).

Given three integers lo, hi and k. The task is to sort all integers in the interval [lo, hi] by the power value in ascending order, if two or more integers have the same power value sort them by ascending order.

Return the k-th integer in the range [lo, hi] sorted by the power value.

```
Example

Input: lo = 12, hi = 15, k = 2
Output: 13
Explanation: The power of 12 is 9 (12 --> 6 --> 3 --> 10 --> 5 --> 16 --> 8 --> 4 --> 2 --> 1)
The power of 13 is 9
The power of 14 is 17
The power of 15 is 17
The interval sorted by the power value [12,13,14,15]. For k = 2 answer is the second element which is 13.
Notice that 12 and 13 have the same power value and we sorted them in ascending order. Same for 14 and 15.
```
Note that 1 <= lo <= hi <= 1000

# Solution
There are not many optimisations which can be done for this question. The only trick is to precompute the powers for 1 to 1000 and store them in a static array. Using a static variable allows us to retain its values across all the tests Leetcode performs so we only have to compute it once for the first test case and then our only job left will be to find the Kth largest value. To answer that, try to solve [LC 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/). There are several techniques to solve this question, the below solution uses a min-heap. Another widely used approach is to use `nth_element` C++ algorithm which employs quick-select algorithm internally (see [votrubac's solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-integers-by-the-power-value/discuss/547055/C%2B%2B-8-ms-precompute-and-partial-sort)).

```
// store powers in static vector
static vector<int> powers;
class Solution {
public:
    // function to compute power of an integer k as per the rules given
    int computePower (int k) {
        int count=0;
        while (k!=1) {
            if (k&1)
                k=k*3+1;
            else
                k/=2;
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }

    int getKth(int lo, int hi, int k) {
        // precompute the powers for the first test case
        if (powers.size()==0) {
            for (int i=1; i<=1000; i++) {
                powers.push_back(computePower(i));
            }
        }

        // lambda comparator for priority queue
        // it compares the integer using powers array
        // if power is equal, give higher priority to lower integer
        auto comp = [](int a, int b) {
            if (powers[a-1]==powers[b-1])
                return a<b;
            return powers[a-1]<powers[b-1];
        };

        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, decltype (comp)> pq(comp);

        for (int i=lo; i<=hi; i++) {
            pq.push(i);
            if (pq.size()>k)
                pq.pop();
        }

        return pq.top();
    }
};
