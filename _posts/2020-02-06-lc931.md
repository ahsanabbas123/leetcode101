# Question
Given a square array of integers A, we want the minimum sum of a falling path through A.

A falling path starts at any element in the first row, and chooses one element from each row.  The next row's choice must be in a column that is different from the previous row's column by at most one.

Example:
```
Input: [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: 12
```

# Solution
Generally, in questions like these where you have to find the optimal path, your answer is dependent of some future information. Like in this question, to find whether A[0][0] will choose A[1][0] or A[1][1], you need to know what those two will be choosing. So a general approach can be to think it in a bottom-up manner rather than top-down manner. Once we know the path from A[1][0] and A[1][1], A[0][0] will simply be choosing `min(A[1][0], A[1][1])`.

Start from the second last row and build the path. A[i][j] will choose `min({A[i+1][j-1], A[i+1][j], A[i+1][j+1]})`. Make sure to handle under/overflow as j-1 can be -1 and j+1 can overflow. Once we have solved for row i, we can similarly solve for row i-1. The answer would be the minimum value in the first row.

```
int minFallingPathSum(vector<vector<int>>& A) {
    int size = A.size();
    if (size == 0)
        return {0};
    
    int ans = INT_MAX;
    
    for (int i=size-2; i>=0; i--) {
        for (int j=0; j<size; j++) {
            A[i][j] += min({A[i+1][max(j-1, 0)], A[i+1][j], A[i+1][min(size-1, j+1)]});
        }
    }
    
    for (int i=0; i<size; i++)
        ans = min(ans, A[0][i]);
    
    return ans;
}
```
Time complexity: O(n^2)<br>
Space complexity: O(1)

Note that it is not a good practice to update the input array so you may use O(n) extra space.
