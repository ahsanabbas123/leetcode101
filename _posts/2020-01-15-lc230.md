title: 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST

Problem: Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.

# Naive solution
A naive approach would be to perform an inorder traversal of the BST, store the result in an array and return the kth element of that array.
Time complexity: O(n) where n is the total number of nodes
Space complexity: O(n)

# Controlled inorder traversal
A controlled inorder traversal can be done using the iterative form of inorder traversal. Please see the solution of [LC 94](https://sarthak-sehgal.github.io/leetcode101/lc94/) for a clear understanding of the iterative traversal.

```
int kthSmallest(TreeNode* root, int k) {
    stack<TreeNode*> s;

    while (!s.empty() || root) {
        while (root) {
            s.push(root);
            root = root->left;
        }
        root = s.top();
        s.pop();
        if (--k == 0) return root->val;
        root = root->right;
    }

    return -1; // we will not reach this statement as k is always <= number of nodes
}
```
Time complexity: O(H+k), where  H H is a tree height. This complexity is defined by the stack, which contains at least H+k elements, since before starting to pop out one has to go down to a leaf. This results in  O (log⁡N + k) for the balanced tree and O(N+k) for completely unbalanced tree with all the nodes in the left subtree.
Space complexity: O(H+k), the same as for time complexity.
