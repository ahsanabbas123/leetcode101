The question can be solved pretty easily in linear time but solving it in O(logn) time is the real trick here. As soon as you see a question asking for O(logn) complexity, the first thing which should come to mind is binary search. We'll implement Binary Search here as well.

Binary search approach:  
Let's say we are at the middle index (mid) b/w the two bounds l (left) and r (right), i.e. mid = l+(r-l)/2 [to prevent overflow]. Now, consider when nums[mid] = nums[mid-1]:

```
1 1 2 2 3 4 4
^     ^     ^
l    mid    r

Now, as nums[mid] = nums[mid-1] and the number of elements b/w l and mid (inclusive) are *even* so that means that the single element cannot lie to the left of mid. So we do `l = mid+1`.

1 1 2 3 3 4 4 8 8
^       ^       ^
l      mid      r
Here, as nums[mid] = nums[mid-1] and the number of elements b/w l and mid (inclusive) are *odd* so that means that the single element *will* lie to the left of mid. So we do `r = mid-2`.
```

Similarly, when nums[mid] = nums[mid+1]:

```
1 1 2 3 3 4 4
^     ^     ^
l    mid    r
Now, as nums[mid] = nums[mid+1] and the number of elements b/w mid and r (inclusive) are *even* so that means that the single element cannot lie to the right of mid. So we do `r = mid-1`.

1 1 3 3 2
^   ^   ^
l  mid  r
Now, as nums[mid] = nums[mid+1] and the number of elements b/w mid and r (inclusive) are *odd* so that means that the single element *will* lie to the right of mid. So we do `l = mid+2`.
```

Code:

```
int singleNonDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
	int l = 0, r = nums.size()-1, mid;

	while (l<r) {
			mid = l+(r-l)/2;

			if (nums[mid]==nums[mid+1]) {
					if ((r-mid)%2==0)
							l=mid+2;
					else
							r=mid-1;
					continue;
			}

			if (nums[mid]==nums[mid-1]) {
					if ((mid-l)%2==0)
							r=mid-2;
					else
							l=mid+1;
					continue;
			}

			return nums[mid];
	}

	return nums[l];
}
```
Time complexity: O(logn)
Space complexity: O(1)

## Same approach, shorter code

```
public static int singleNonDuplicate(int[] nums) {
	int start = 0, end = nums.length - 1;

	while (start < end) {
			// We want the first element of the middle pair,
			// which should be at an even index if the left part is sorted.
			// Example:
			// Index: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
			// Array: 1 1 3 3 4 8 8
			//            ^
			int mid = (start + end) / 2;
			if (mid % 2 == 1) mid--;

			// We didn't find a pair. The single element must be on the left.
			// (pipes mean start & end)
			// Example: |0 1 1 3 3 6 6|
			//               ^ ^
			// Next:    |0 1 1|3 3 6 6
			if (nums[mid] != nums[mid + 1]) end = mid;

			// We found a pair. The single element must be on the right.
			// Example: |1 1 3 3 5 6 6|
			//               ^ ^
			// Next:     1 1 3 3|5 6 6|
			else start = mid + 2;
	}

	// 'start' should always be at the beginning of a pair.
	// When 'start > end', start must be the single element.
	return nums[start];
}
