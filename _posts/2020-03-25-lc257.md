# Question
Given a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths.
```
Example
Input:

   1
 /   \
2     3
 \
  5

Output: ["1->2->5", "1->3"]
```

# Solution
The solution is straightforward and the given function can be called recursively without using any other helper function.
```
vector<string> binaryTreePaths(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root)
        return {};
    
    vector<string> left, right, res;
    left = binaryTreePaths(root->left);
    right = binaryTreePaths(root->right);
    
    for (string s : left) {
        res.push_back(to_string(root->val)+"->"+s);
    }
    for (string s : right) {
        res.push_back(to_string(root->val)+"->"+s);
    }
    
    if (res.size()==0)
        res={to_string(root->val)};
    
    return res;
}
```

Note that the time complexity is not O(n) as string concatenation takes up a lot of time. It will take more time that O(n). Some people have argued that it is O(nlogn). O(n^2) is definitely a correct bound though it might not be a tight bound.
