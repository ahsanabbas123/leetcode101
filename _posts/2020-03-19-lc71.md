# Solution
The approach is to use a stack to store all the valid directory names and pop from the stack whenever we encounter "../" (or a ".." at the end of the string). We have to ignore all occurrences of "./" (or a "." at the end of string) and "/".
Instead of using std::stack, let's use std::vector as it retains the correct order of directories (instead of reversing it in a LIFO based stack) which will be helpful when we form our answer string. For better understanding, view the code:
```
string simplifyPath(string path) {
    // sanity check
    if (path == "")
        return "";
    
    string ans = "", s="";
    vector<string> st;
    
    for (int i=1; i<path.length(); ) {
        // ignore if it is a slash
        if (path[i] == '/') {
            i++;
            continue;
        }
        
        // check if it is "../" or ".." (only at the end of string)
        if (path.substr(i, 3) == "../" || path.substr(i, 3) == "..") {
            if (!st.empty())
                st.pop_back();
            i+=3;
            continue;
        }
        
        // check if it is "./" or "." (only at the end of string)
        if (path.substr(i,2) == "./" || path.substr(i,2) == ".") {
            i+=2;
            continue;
        }
        
        // push the directory name to stack
        s="";
        while (i<path.length() && path[i]!='/') s+=path[i++];
        st.push_back(s);
    }
    
    for (string str : st)
        ans+="/" + str;
    
    return ans == "" ? "/" : ans;
}
```
Time complexity: O(n) where n is the size of given path
